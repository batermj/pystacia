- mooar tests
- coverage
- docs
- docstrings
- revise imports, move in function symbols at the end of files
- when searching override define templates for other platforms
- overrides from update soname to outdated soname
- drop lazy enum, keep and make string passing possible [x]?
- should getters and setters be explicit?
- those semaphores thing possibly should keep week references to any magick resource and clear it on exit [0.1.1]
- move enum lookups based on versions to api.enum module (version param is None) [0.1.1]
- move color to be a class and have @staticmethod __getattr__ style called Factory in tinyimg.color
  and imported this class as color into tinyimg like color.white, color.transparent, [0.1.1]
- more generators from pseudoformats: plasma, checkerboard, gradients etc [0.1.1]
- put generators together under some submodule, name?
- fit method [0.1.1]
- get_pixel, set_pixel [0.1.1]
- lazy init of imagick and function prototypes [0.1.1]
- keep track of showed temp files and delete them on exit [0.1.1]
- rgb8, rgba8 color factory, and accessors [0.1.1]
- @api_simple_call [0.1.1]
- support for with protocol [0.1.1]
- extract base class TinyBase with closed, close, with protocol and constructor (under util)? [0.1.1]
- implement other color factories [0.2]
- add env variable to force immediate init of imagick [0.2]
- implement better show tool detecting (eog on linux e.g) and fallback to webbrowser [0.2]
- search path alteration logic [0.2]
- smart detecting and lazy loading of API prototypes (based on maybe docs, and decorators)
  once new api submodule also has functions inside [0.2]
- rope in logging in crucial moments, specifically init and finding lib [0.2]
- bench script to test under different version of python [0.2]
- pixel iterators [0.2]
- ping [0.2]
- show should accept zoom factor, passed to resize with point filter, and crop information [0.2]
- show for color creates 32x32 image with color preview [0.2]
- [0.2] hsl, cmyk setters and getters
- implement gravity=(0, 0) gravity=(.5, 1) gravity=('left') on merge, crop, extend, rotate(crop=True), resize [0.2]

TODO
====

- move factory choosing code to a separate function
- thread/local, global registry
- figure out how to do basicConfig
- subprocess loading of libraries optionall with pyro [0.3]
- instead of relying on renames and get_platfom we could use our own solution [0.1.1]
  if it can be loaded and test for OS and 64bit in setyp.py
- research auto_level, auto_gamma
- document splice, implement implode
- weakrefing cached lena should be only used in tests [0.1.1]
- investigate __all__ of main module, image and color
- setting factories globally [0.1.1] if you want to use a subclass
- i.e. registry module to use for paths, chainability and any other things
  that affect runtime
- more methods for image [0.1.1]
- more generators from pseudoformats: plasma, checkerboard, gradients etc [0.1.1]
- Image.write should obey format when explicitely set, ImageMagick always does it
  from filename, if format is set call get_blob() instead and save to fs in py
  into one class with many test methods [0.1.1]
- compress method that let's you apply compression and reread image, useful for
  preving compression result
- make string passing possible [x]? [0.1.1]
- fit method [0.1.1]
- set_pixel (possible?) [0.1.1]
- keep track of showed temp files and delete them on exit
- rgb8, rgba8 color factory, and accessors [0.1.1]
- support for with protocol [0.1.1]
- document origin of name pistacja, wÅ‚oski, pistachio, pronunciation [0.1.1]
- info method (returns all the crucial magick informations along with loaded libraries and paths)
- implement other color factories [0.2]
- implement better show tool detecting (doesnt work with unity) and fallback to webbrowser [0.2]
- allow overriding viewer wiith TINYIMG_VIEWER env var
- containers vs formats
- bench script to test under different version of python [0.2]
- pixel iterators [0.2]
- ping [0.2]
- show should accept zoom factor, passed to resize with point filter, and crop information [0.2]
- show for color creates 32x32 image with color preview [0.2]
- [0.2] hsl, cmyk setters and getters
- implement gravity=(0, 0) gravity=(.5, 1) gravity=('left') on merge, crop, extend, rotate(crop=True), resize [0.2]
- with img.masked(mask) as img:
- with img.canvas() as c:
- all functions should accept blend as param - merges result on top with this blend
- visual testing framework with reference images
- wave needs phi
- copy parameter to each function as kw, along blend
- blending gravity
- checker in show, zoom, crop
- > and < on color lightness comparison
